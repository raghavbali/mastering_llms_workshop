# Language Model Fundamentals

This module introduces the foundational concepts of representing and embedding text for language models. It covers both traditional and modern approaches for converting raw text into machine-understandable vectors, starting from basic text representations to advanced contextual embeddings using state-of-the-art transformer models.

### Text Representation: From Tokens to Embeddings

[01_text_representation.ipynb](01_text_representation.ipynb)  
Learn about the importance of feature engineering for text data, including various tokenization strategies (character-level, word-level), vectorization techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF, and powerful word embedding models like Word2Vec and FastText. Practical implementations are provided using real-world text datasets and visualizations of word embeddings.

### Contextual Embeddings: Understanding Words in Context

[02_contextual_embeddings.ipynb](02_contextual_embeddings.ipynb)  
Delve into how modern language models generate embeddings that capture word meaning based on surrounding context, overcoming the limitations of static embeddings. The notebook demonstrates the use of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, MiniLM) for producing contextual embeddings and explores their applications in tasks like semantic search, showing how the same word can have different representations depending on its usage.
